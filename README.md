On the regular release schedule:

  - deployed to DEV/TEST/STAGE Wednesday after 5pm,
  - and, if QA passes, on production by Thursday afternoon.
- Changes made by Wednesday 5pm will be

This is the regular schedule: If something needs to be out faster, we can try to make it happen;
Conversely, sometimes there are problems with other systems which block release to production.

## **This shouldn't be where you read the docs!**

If you're here to read documentation, use [the Portal](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/docs/) instead!

This repo is mirrored there, and in that context, the URLS don't include `.md`.
As a consequence, links between documents in here in Github won't work. Besides that, the docs also reference other portions of the site that aren't in this repo at all.
